# MiniML: Data Preprocessing & Linear Regression

✨ This is a mini project developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence course.  
It focuses on **data preprocessing, handling missing values, and building a simple Linear Regression model** using Python.

---

## 📌 Features
- Handling missing data using imputation (mean strategy)
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Building and training a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating the model with R² score
- Visualizing correlations with a heatmap

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)  
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)  
- [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)  
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)  
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)  

---

## 📊 Example Output
- R² Score printed in the console
- Correlation heatmap generated with Seaborn
